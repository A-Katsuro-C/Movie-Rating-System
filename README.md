# Reflection Questions 
1: Nested if statements have if/if-else statments inside of other if/if-else statments.
2: Switch statemtns allow you to code more efficiently with a sligth sarcrifice of lower readability. 
3: The conditional operator simplificies decision-making by allowing all the code of an if...else statment to be written on one line, however with that comes the problem of it being harder to read at first glance.
4: Short-circuit evaluations uses the AND and OR operator and evaluates the expression based as what is only necessary to make that decision. Meaning if the expression is true in the first half of an OR statment first, it will go ahead with the execution of the code below instead of deciding if the other half of the expression is true as well.
